                        Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft. It is
                        used to develop
                        computer programs including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio
                        uses Microsoft
                        software development platforms including Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation
                        Foundation (WPF),
                        Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.
                        <br> <br>

                        Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component)
                        as well as code
                        refactoring. The integrated debugger works as both a source-level debugger and as a
                        machine-level debugger.
                        Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web
                        designer, class
                        designer, and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at
                        almost every
                        level—including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and
                        adding new toolsets
                        like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other
                        aspects of the software
                        development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer). <br><br>

                        Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages [citation needed] and allows the
                        code editor and
                        debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a
                        language-specific service
                        exists. Built-in languages include C,[6] C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#,[7]
                        JavaScript, TypeScript,
                        XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Support for other languages such as Python,[8] Ruby, Node.js, and
                        M among others is
                        available via plug-ins. Java (and J#) were supported in the past. <br><br>

                        The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge.
                        The slogan for
                        Visual Studio Community edition is "Free, fully-featured IDE for students, open-source and
                        individual
                        developers". As of February 19, 2024, Visual Studio 2022 is a current production-ready
                        version. Visual Studio
                        2013, 2015 and 2017 are on Extended Support, while 2019 is on Mainstream Support.[9]

                        <strong> Atom</strong> is a free and open-source text and source-code editor for macOS, Linux,
                        and Windows
                        with support for
                        plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git control. Developed by GitHub, Atom was released
                        on June 25,
                        2015.[8] <br><br>

                        On June 8, 2022, GitHub announced Atom's end-of-life, occurring on December 15 of the same year,
                        justifying
                        its need "to prioritize technologies that enable the future of software development",
                        specifically its GitHub
                        Codespaces and Visual Studio Code, developed by Microsoft which had acquired GitHub in
                        2018.[9][10]

                        <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>Features</strong></h3>
                        Atom is a "hackable" text editor, which means it is customizable using HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript.[11] <br><br>

                        Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.[12] It is based on the Electron
                        framework, which
                        was developed for that purpose, and hence was formerly called Atom Shell.[13] Electron is a
                        framework that
                        enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.[14][15] <br><br>

                        Atom was initially written in CoffeeScript and Less, but much of it was converted to
                        JavaScript.[16] <br><br>

                        Atom uses Tree-sitter to provide syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages and file
                        formats.[17]

                        code snippets.
                        It functions as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers can
                        create code
                        snippets, called "pens," and test them. It was founded in 2012 by full-stack developers Alex

                        Sabat and front-end designer Chris Coyier.[1][2][non-primary source needed] Its employees work
                        remotely,
                        rarely all meeting together in person. CodePen is a large community for web designers and
                        developers to

                        user-created and collaborational HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets, known as 'fiddles'. It
                        allows for
                        simulated AJAX calls. In 2019, JSFiddle was ranked the second most popular online IDE by the

                        Programming Language (PYPL) index based on the number of times it was searched, directly behind
                        Cloud9 IDE,
                        worldwide[1] and in the USA.[2] <br><br>

                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>Concept</strong></h3>
                        JSFiddle is an online IDE which is designed to allow users to edit and run HTML, JavaScript, and
                        CSS code on a
                        single page.[3] Its interface is minimalist and split into four main frames, which correspond to
                        editable
                        HTML, JavaScript and CSS fields and a result field which displays the user's project after it is
                        run. [3]
                        Since early on, JSFiddle adopted smart source-code editor with programming features. <br><br>

                        As of 2020, JSFiddle uses CodeMirror to support its editable fields, providing multicursors,
                        syntax
                        highlighting, syntax verification (linter), brace matching, auto indentation, autocompletion,
                        code/text
                        folding, Search and Replace to assist web developers in their actions.[4] On the left, a sidebar
                        allows users
                        to integrate external resources such as external CSS stylesheets and external JavaScript
                        libraries. The most
                        popular JavaScript frameworks and CSS frameworks are suggested to users and available via a
                        click. <br><br>

                        JSFiddle allows users to publicly save their code an uncapped number of times for free.[3] Each
                        version is
                        saved online at the application's website with an incremental numbered suffix.[citation needed]
                        This allows
                        users to re-access their saved code.[3] Code saved on JSFiddle may also be edited into new
                        versions, shared
                        with other parties, and forked into a new line.[3] <br><br>

                        JSFiddle is widely used among web developers to share simple tests and demonstrations. JSFiddle
                        is also widely
                        used on Stack Overflow, the dominant question-answer online forum for the web industry.

                        platform allows server-side software such as Node.js to be run entirely in the web browser,
                        enabling fully
                        online full-stack development.[3] A number of web frameworks such as React, Next.js and Angular

                        supported.[4] <br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>History</strong></h3>
                        StackBlitz was released to the public on August 2, 2017 by entrepreneur Eric Simons as an online
                        integrated
                        development environment for creating and sharing Angular and React projects.[1] Prior to
                        launching StackBlitz,
                        Simons had attracted media attention by secretly living at AOL headquarters for two months in
                        2011 while
                        working on a different startup company.[5][6][7] <br><br>

                        In May 2021, StackBlitz released WebContainers, a containerization solution that allowed
                        server-side runtime
                        environments such as Node.js to operate fully with web browsers. The company stated that the
                        technology could
                        boot development environments in less than a second, and was more secure than local environments
                        due to
                        running fully within the browser sandbox.[8] <br><br>

                        <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>Features</strong></h3><br>
                        StackBlitz offers an online integrated development environment that operates fully within a
                        user's web browser
                        as opposed to a more traditional local development environment. The software primarily
                        emphasizes JavaScript
                        development and has a large number of web framework templates readily available. Other Node.js,
                        Python and PHP
                        projects are also supported.[9]

                        <strong> Replit</strong>, formerly Repl.it, is an American start-up and an online integrated
                        development
                        environment (IDE).[3] Replit allows users to create online programming projects called repls.[4]

                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        Replit was co-founded by programmers Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh in
                        2016.[1][2] It was
                        incorporated in San Mateo.[5] Once listed as a co-founder alongside Masad, Max Shawabkeh left
                        the venture
                        early on.[6][7][8] Its name comes from the acronym REPL, which stands for "read–evaluate–print
                        loop". <br><br>

                        Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at Yahoo and Facebook, where he
                        built
                        development tools. He also helped found Codecademy. Masad had come up with the idea for Replit
                        over a decade
                        before its creation.[9] <br><br>

                        In 2009, Amjad Masad sought to write implementations of other programming languages in
                        JavaScript, but
                        realized it was not practically feasible. He saw great leaps in browser and web technologies and
                        was inspired
                        by the web capabilities of Google Docs. He thought of the idea of being able to write and share
                        code all in a
                        web browser. He spent two years creating an open-source product with Haya Odeh called
                        "JSRepl".[10] This
                        product allowed him to compile languages into JavaScript. It powered Udacity and Codecademy's
                        tutorials. After
                        becoming an early employee of Codecademy, this project was put off until years later, when he
                        and Odeh decided
                        to revive the project of a programming environment in a browser.[3][9] <br><br>

                        As Replit was taking shape, Masad and Odeh wanted to have "a real environment and not something
                        emulated in
                        the browser." The focus was first directed at the education market, and then later towards
                        professional
                        developers.[3] <br><br>

                        Since March 2021, "replit.com" has been the default domain name for the web service replacing
                        the older
                        "repl.it". This change was attributed to Masad's preference that people pronounce the website's
                        name as
                        /ˈrɛplɪt/ instead of /ˈrɛpəl/.[10] Another reason cited by Masad was issues with the ".it"
                        top-level domain,
                        such as renewal restrictions.[11] <br><br>

                        Replit originally was only a REPL. However, the Ace editor was eventually implemented, allowing
                        for editing of
                        programs as well. In 2017, Replit switched to the Monaco code editor, the same editor used in
                        Visual Studio
                        Code. Due to issues with mobile support, the code editor was switched to CodeMirror over 2021 -
                        2022.[12] This
                        decision was met with backlash and criticism from the Replit community, which eventually calmed
                        down after
                        bugs and major issues were addressed. <br><br>

                        Replit offered Teams for Education,[13] a product to assist in teaching programming in the
                        classroom. It was
                        announced that from November 15th 2023, bug fixes and features would no longer be added to teams
                        for
                        education.[14] <br><br>

                        In 2024 it was announced that Replit would be moving from its SoMa headquarters in San Francisco
                        to a new
                        location in Foster City.[15][16]

                        CoffeeCup HTML Editor is an HTML editor. Originally created by Nicholas Longo and Kevin Jurica,
                        it was first
                        released to the public in August 1996. Until version 12.5 released in 2012, it was capable of
                        WYSIWYG editing.
                        <br><br>

                        In later versions, editing is done using HTML code, supported and assisted by a number of
                        built-in features to
                        generate and check code. While coding, a web browser preview would continuously update in a
                        separate window or
                        a split part of the main editor window (split-screen editing). However, the running internal
                        preview stopped
                        working sometime in 2023, because it relied on the long-deprecated browser Internet Explorer,
                        which Microsoft
                        disabled in a Windows update that year. In a support answer in November 2023, the Sales &
                        Support Manager
                        wrote: "At this time we do [not] have an alternative for the internal preview. We are working to
                        rebuild the
                        whole app for Chrome but we don't have an eta [estimated time of arrival] yet for that. In the
                        mean time you
                        would need to use the external preview in the browser of your choice." <br><br>

                        The external preview, in a separate window, can use any and all web browsers installed on the
                        user's computer,
                        but must be refreshed manually. It does not update continuously while coding. <br><br>

                        According to the authors the editor was the first to support JavaScript (version 3.5 Sep. 1996),
                        split-screen
                        editing (version 4.0, March 1997) and built-in FTP upload (version 5.2, February 1998). <br><br>

                        It was voted Best Windows HTML Editor in the About.com Readers' Choice Awards two years in a row
                        in 2011 and
                        2012.[1]

                        Get straight to coding without having to install and configure lots of plugins. WebStorm
                        includes everything
                        you need for JavaScript and TypeScript development right from the start. You can personalize it

                        various plugins and settings. <br><br>

                        With WebStorm, you don't need to be an expert at everything. You can rely on it for the most
                        challenging
                        tasks. Whether you’re resolving Git merge conflicts or renaming a symbol across multiple files,
                        it takes just
                        a few clicks. As your projects grow in size and complexity, WebStorm will help you explore your
                        entire
                        codebase faster and refactor it safely.

                        developed by JetBrains
                        (formerly known as IntelliJ) and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition,[3] and
                        in a
                        proprietary commercial edition. Both can be used for commercial development.[4][5]

                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        The first version of IntelliJ IDEA was released in January 2001 and was one of the first
                        available Java IDEs
                        with advanced code navigation and code refactoring capabilities integrated.[6][7] <br><br>

                        In 2009, JetBrains released the source code for IntelliJ IDEA under the open-source Apache
                        License 2.0.[8][9]
                        JetBrains also began distributing a limited version of IntelliJ IDEA consisting of open-source
                        features under
                        the moniker Community Edition. The commercial Ultimate Edition provides additional features and
                        remains
                        available for a fee. <br><br>

                        In a 2010 InfoWorld report, IntelliJ received the highest test center score out of the four top
                        Java
                        programming tools: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans and JDeveloper.[10] <br><br>

                        In December 2014, Google announced version 1.0 of Android Studio, an open-source IDE for Android
                        apps, based
                        on the open source community edition.[11] Other development environments based on IntelliJ's
                        framework include
                        AppCode, CLion, DataGrip, GoLand, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, WebStorm, and MPS.[12]

                        In September 2020, Huawei announced and released version 1.0 of DevEco Studio, an open-source

                        HarmonyOS apps development, based on Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA with Huawei's SmartAssist for

                        <strong> UltraEdit</strong> is a text editor for Microsoft Windows, Linux,[1] and MacOS. It was
                        initially
                        developed in 1994 by Ian D. Mead, the founder of IDM Computer Solutions Inc.,[2] and was
                        acquired by Idera
                        Inc. in the August of 2021. Originally called MEDIT, it was first designed to run on Windows
                        3.1. A version
                        called UltraEdit-32 was later created to run on Windows NT and Windows 95. The last 16-bit
                        UltraEdit program
                        version was 6.20b. UltraEdit-32 was later renamed to UltraEdit in version 14.00. Version 22.2
                        was the first
                        native 64-bit version of the text editor. Starting with 2022.0 (successor of 28.20), versioning
                        had become
                        year-based.[3]

                        <strong>Brackets</strong> is a source code editor with a primary focus on web development.[5] Created by Adobe
                        Inc., it is free and open-source software licensed under the MIT License, and is currently maintained on
                        GitHub by open-source developers. It is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Brackets is cross-platform,
                        available for macOS, Windows, and most Linux distributions. The main purpose of Brackets is its live HTML, CSS
                        and JavaScript editing functionality.[6] <br><br>
              
                        On November 4, 2014, Adobe announced the first (1.0) release of Brackets. The update introduced new features
                        such as custom shortcut key combinations and more accurate JavaScript hinting. Brackets has a major focus on
                        development in JavaScript-enabled, CSS and HTML. With release of version 1.0, Adobe announced a feature that
                        extracts design information from a PSD file for convenience of coding in CSS.[7] As of June 28, 2016, the
                        feature is officially discontinued, due to low usage.[8] However, Extract is still available via Photoshop and
                        Dreamweaver, both of which are part of their paid service, Adobe Creative Cloud.[9] In March 2021, Adobe
                        announced it would end their support for Brackets on September 1, 2021. <br><br>
              
                        The Brackets project was subsequently transferred to become a community-owned and driven project. The latest
                        version release of Brackets is 2.2.1.[10]<br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        Adobe first started development of a text editor for web development on Edge Code, which was discontinued as
                        of November 2014.[11] This effort was later transformed into Adobe Brackets. With the release of Brackets 1.0,
                        Adobe announced that the development of an open source application for web development was ready and was not
                        an experimental project any more. Brackets contains contributions by more than 282 community contributors and
                        has more than 400 requests for bug fixes and new features. Every version of Brackets had more than 100,000
                        downloads, and it was the 16th most popular project on GitHub as of January 16, 2015.[12] <br><br>
              
                        The Brackets repository on GitHub (Bracket repository) currently has 152 branches, 110 releases and 17,700
                        commits as of 30 Aug 2018. The source code is freely available under the MIT license. A developer can alter
                        features on Brackets and personalize it for one's own convenience by forking the software code.[13] <br><br>
              
                        Adobe officially dropped support for Brackets on September 1, 2021 and recommended users migrate to
                        Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.[14] The final official release was version 1.14.2, but a community fork
                        continues to release newer versions.[15][16] In addition to the community continuation fork, Brackets
                        community contributors announced Phoenix on August 30, 2021.[17] Phoenix is a fork of Brackets targeting web
                        browsers, as opposed to being a native application.[18]

                        <strong>Apache NetBeans</strong> is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. NetBeans allows
                        applications to be developed
                        from a set of modular software components called modules. NetBeans runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris.
                        In addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like PHP, C, C++, HTML5,[3] and
                        JavaScript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third party
                        developers.[4]<br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        NetBeans began in 1996 as Xelfi (word play on Delphi),[5][6] a Java IDE student project under the guidance of
                        the Faculty of Engineering and Technology at Charles University in Prague. In 1997, Roman Staněk formed a
                        company around the project and produced commercial versions of the NetBeans IDE until it was bought by Sun
                        Microsystems in 1999. Sun open-sourced the NetBeans IDE in June of the following year. Since then, the
                        NetBeans community has continued to grow.[7] In 2010, Sun (and thus NetBeans) was acquired by Oracle
                        Corporation. Under Oracle, NetBeans had to find some synergy with JDeveloper, a freeware IDE that has
                        historically been a product of the company, by 2012 both IDEs were rebuilt around a shared codebase - the
                        NetBeans Platform. In September 2016, Oracle submitted a proposal to donate the NetBeans project to The Apache
                        Software Foundation, stating that it was "opening up the NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans
                        constituents a greater voice in the project's direction and future success through the upcoming release of
                        Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond". The move was endorsed by Java creator James Gosling.[8] The project entered
                        the Apache Incubator in October 2016.[9]

                        Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi.
                        Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga[6] and released a version
                        to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone
                        application in a graphical user interface.[7] Since its release for the Amiga, cross-platform development has
                        made it available on many other systems. In 2018, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal
                        readers;[8] in 2015 the Stack Overflow developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor,[9]
                        and in 2019 the fifth most popular development environment.[10]<br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        Vim's forerunner, Stevie (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts), was created by Tim Thompson for the Atari ST in
                        1987[11][12] and further developed by Tony Andrews[11][13] and G.R. (Fred) Walter.[14][15] It was one of the
                        first popularized clones of Vi, and did not use Vi's source code. The source code for Vi used the Ed text
                        editor developed under AT&T, and therefore Vi could only be used by those with an AT&T source
                        license.[citation needed] Basing Vim on the source code for Stevie meant the program could be distributed
                        without requiring the AT&T source license. <br><br>
              
                        Basing his work on Stevie, Bram Moolenaar began working on Vim for the Amiga computer in 1988, with the first
                        public release (Vim v1.14) in 1991.[16][17][better source needed] <br><br>
              
                        At the time of its first release, the name "Vim" was an acronym for "Vi IMitation", but this changed to "'Vi
                        IMproved" late in 1993.[18]

                        Notepad++ is a free and open-source text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports
                        tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The product's name comes
                        from the C postfix increment operator; it is sometimes referred to as npp or NPP.[5] <br><br>
              
                        Notepad++ is distributed as free software. At first, the project was hosted on SourceForge, from where it was
                        downloaded over 28 million times[6][7] and twice won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer
                        Tool.[8] The project was hosted on TuxFamily [fr] from 2010 to 2015; since 2015, Notepad++ has been hosted on
                        GitHub.[9] Notepad++ uses the Scintilla editor component.<br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #03a9f4;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        Notepad++ was developed by Don Ho in September 2003.[10] Ho first used JEXT (a Java-based text editor) at his
                        company but, dissatisfied with its poor performance, he began to develop a text editor written in C++ with
                        Scintilla.[10] He developed it in his spare time since the idea was rejected by his company.[10] Notepad++ was
                        built as a Microsoft Windows application; the author considered, but rejected, the idea of using wxWidgets to
                        port it to the Mac OS X and Unix platforms.[10] <br><br>
              
                        Notepad++ was first released on SourceForge on 25 November 2003, as a Windows-only application. It is based on
                        the Scintilla editor component, and is written in C++ with only Win32 API calls using only the STL to increase
                        performance and reduce program size.[11][12] <br><br>
              
                        In January 2010 the US government obliged US-based open source project hosts to deny access from Cuba, Iran,
                        North Korea, Sudan, and Syria to comply with U.S. law.[13] As a response to what the developer felt was a
                        violation of the free and open-source software (FOSS) philosophy, in June 2010 Notepad++ moved out of US
                        territorial jurisdiction by releasing a version on TuxFamily, in France. Some community services of Notepad++
                        (such as the forums and bug tracker) remained on SourceForge until 2015 when Notepad++ left SourceForge
                        completely.[14][15][16] <br><br>
              
                        In 2011 Lifehacker described Notepad++ as "The Best Programming Text Editor for Windows", stating that "if you
                        prefer a simple, lightweight, and extensible programming plain-text editor, our first choice is the free,
                        open-source Notepad++".[17] Lifehacker criticized its user interface, stating that "It is, in fact, fairly
                        ugly. Luckily you can do a lot to customize its looks, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in
                        functionality".[17] <br><br>
              
                        In 2014 Lifehacker readers voted Notepad++ as the "Most Popular Text Editor", with 40% of the 16,294
                        respondents specifying it as their most-loved editor.[18] The Lifehacker team summarized the program as being
                        "fast, flexible, feature-packed, and completely free".[18] <br><br>
              
                        In 2015 Stack Overflow conducted a worldwide Developer Survey, and Notepad++ was voted as the most used text
                        editor worldwide with 34.7% of the 26,086 respondents claiming to use it daily.[19] Stack Overflow noted that
                        "The more things change, the more likely it is those things are written in JavaScript with NotePad++ on a
                        Windows machine".[19] The 2016 survey had Notepad++ at 35.6%.[20] <br><br>
              
                        In 2015, in response to the staff hijacking of projects hosted on SourceForge, Notepad++ left SourceForge
                        completely with the forums being moved to NodeBB and the bug tracker to GitHub.[16][21]

                        <strong>GNU Emacs</strong> is a free software text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard
                        Stallman, based on the
                        Emacs editor developed for Unix operating systems. GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project
                        and a flagship project of the free software movement.[4][5] Its tag line is "the extensible self-documenting
                        text editor."[6]<br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
                        The original EMACS was written in 1976 by David A. Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of macros for the TECO
                        editor, and in 1984, Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs, to produce a free software alternative to the
                        proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its
                        Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This
                        became the first program released by the then-nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides
                        Emacs Lisp, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on
                        March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985.
                        Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as "1.x.x," with the initial digit denoting the version of the C
                        core. The "1" was dropped after version 1.12 as it was thought that the major number would never change, and
                        thus the major version skipped from "1" to "13". A new third version number was added to represent changes
                        made by user sites.[7] In the current numbering scheme, a number with two components signifies a release
                        version, with development versions having three components.[8] <br><br>
              
                        GNU Emacs was later ported to the Unix operating system. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in
                        particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the de facto
                        Unix Emacs editor. Markus Hess exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs's email subsystem in his 1986 cracking
                        spree, in which he gained superuser access to Unix computers.[9] <br><br>
              
                        Although users commonly submitted patches and Elisp code to the net.emacs newsgroup, participation in GNU
                        Emacs development was relatively restricted until 1999, and was used as an example of the "Cathedral"
                        development style in The Cathedral and the Bazaar. The project has since adopted a public development mailing
                        list and anonymous CVS access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008, and today uses the
                        Git[10] DVCS. <br><br>
              
                        Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at

                        <strong>BareBones Edit</strong> is a proprietary text editor made by Bare Bones Software, originally developed
                        for Macintosh System Software 6, and currently supporting macOS.<br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History -</strong></h3><br>
                        The first version of BBEdit was created as a "bare bones" text editor to serve as a "proof of concept"; the
                        intention was to demonstrate the programming capabilities of an experimental version of Pascal for the
                        Macintosh. The original prototypes of BBEdit used the TextEdit control available in versions of the classic
                        Mac OS of the time. The TextEdit control could not load files larger than 32 KB. The Macintosh Pascal project
                        was ultimately terminated, but the demonstration program was reworked to use the THINK Technologies "PE" text
                        editing engine used for THINK C, which was much faster and could read larger files. BBEdit was the first
                        freestanding text editor to use the "PE" editing engine, and is the only one still being developed. <br><br>
              
                        BBEdit was available at no charge upon its initial release in 1992 but was commercialized in May 1993 with the
                        release of version 2.5.[3] At the same time, Bare Bones Software also made a less-featured version of BBEdit
                        2.5 called BBEdit Lite available at no cost. BBEdit Lite lacked plugin support, scriptability, syntax coloring
                        and other features then deemed as mainly for advanced users. Bare Bones Software discontinued BBEdit Lite at
                        version 6.1 and replaced it with TextWrangler, which was available for a fee, although significantly less than
                        BBEdit. In 2005, TextWrangler 2.0 was released as freeware and subsequent versions continued to be distributed
                        as such[4] up until 2017, when it was sunsetted and incorporated into BBEdit.[5] <br><br>
              
                        Throughout its history, BBEdit has supported many Apple technologies that failed to gain traction, including
                        OpenDoc and PowerTalk. The failure of PowerTalk, and the desire of developers to have email integrated to
                        their text editor, led to the development of Mailsmith, an email client that uses BBEdit's editor component.
                        Formerly developed by Bare Bones as a commercial application, in 2009 Mailsmith was transferred to Stickshift
                        Software LLC and would continue to be developed as a labor of love and released as freeware.[6] Development of
                        Mailsmith ceased in 2018.[7] <br><br>
              
                        In 1994, taking advantage of BBEdit's then-novel plugin support, third party developers started writing
                        plug-ins to easily create and format HTML code. In fact, the developers at Bare Bones Software first learned
                        of the existence of HTML through users inquiring about these plug-ins. Barebones later bought the rights to
                        the plugin code from their author and included them as part of the standard BBEdit package. The tools were
                        included as an optional palette in version 4, and were progressively more integrated, gaining their own menu
                        in version 5.0.[8] In version 4.5, Bare Bones introduced BBEdit Table Builder as an additional tool for web
                        designers and developers to visually design HTML tables, then the main technique for layout control on web
                        pages.[9][10] Table Builder was removed in version 6.0, since enhancing it would involve replicating the
                        features of existing visual HTML editors, and BBEdit was at this time bundled with Dreamweaver.[11] BBEdit's
                        plugin support was removed in version 9.6, in favor of the expanded selection of scripting languages available
                        on Mac OS X. <br><br>
              
                        BBEdit was one of the first applications to be made available for Mac OS X, as a Carbon app. On macOS, BBEdit
                        takes advantage of the operating system's Unix underpinnings by integrating scripts written in Python, Perl,
                        or other common Unix scripting languages, as well as adding features such as shell worksheets that provide a
                        screen editor interface to command line functionality similar to MPW Worksheets and Emacs shell buffers. <br><br>
              
                        BBEdit's creator code R*ch refers to Rich Siegel, one of Bare Bones Software's founders and the original
                        author of BBEdit.

                        <strong>TextMate</strong> is a free and open-source general-purpose GUI text editor for macOS created by Allan Odgaard. TextMate features declarative customizations, tabs for open documents, recordable macros, folding sections, snippets, shell integration, and an extensible bundle system. <br><br>
                        <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>History -</strong></h3><br>
                        TextMate 1.0 was released on 5 October 2004, after 5 months of development, followed by version 1.0.1 on 21 October 2004.[2][3][4] The release focused on implementing a small feature set well, and did not have a preference window or a toolbar, didn't integrate FTP, and had no options for printing.[5][6] At first only a small number of programming languages were supported, as only a few “language bundles” had been created. Even so, some developers found this early and incomplete version of TextMate a welcome change to a market that was considered stagnated by the decade-long dominance of BBEdit.[7] <br><br>
              
                        TextMate 1.0.2 came out on 10 December 2004. In the series of TextMate 1.1 betas, TextMate gained features: a preferences window with a GUI for creating and editing themes; a status bar with a symbol list; menus for choosing language and tab settings, and a “bundle editor” for editing language-specific customizations. On 6 January 2006, Odgaard released TextMate 1.5, the first “stable release” since 1.0.2.[8] Reviews were positive, in contrast to earlier versions that had been criticised.[9] <br><br>
                        
                        TextMate continued to develop through mid-2006. On 8 August 2006, TextMate was awarded the Apple Design Award for Best Developer Tool, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California.[10] In February 2006, the TextMate blog expressed intentions for future directions, including improved project management, with a plug-in system to support remote file systems such as FTP, and revision control systems such as Subversion.[11] Throughout 2007, the core application changed only minimally, though its “language bundles” continued to advance. <br><br>
                        
                        In June 2009, TextMate 2 was announced as being about 90 percent complete, but with an undisclosed final-feature list.[12] A public alpha was made available for download on the TextMate blog in December 2011, followed by a release candidate at the end of 2016. In September 2019, a final version was released.[13] <br><br>
                        
                        In August 2012, TextMate 2's source code was published on GitHub under the terms of GPL-3.0-or-later,[14] an attempt by the developer to counteract restrictions Apple placed on software distributed through the Mac App Store.[15] Odgaard stated he prefers receiving patches as public domain as this preserves his ability to release a future version under a more permissive license, or to make a version available on the Mac App Store. Odgaard also stated he has a friend who uses some of TextMate's frameworks in a closed-source project, and they could not incorporate patches released under GPL.[16][17] <br><br>
                        
                        In October 2021, the latest/last commit was made to GitHub, though no announcement has been made to the effect that the project has been officially abandoned and its source code is still publicly available.[18]

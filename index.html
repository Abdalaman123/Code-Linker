          Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Microsoft. It is used to develop
          computer programs including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft
          software development platforms including Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF),
          Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code. <br> <br>

          Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code
          refactoring. The integrated debugger works as both a source-level debugger and as a machine-level debugger.
          Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class
          designer, and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every
          level—including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets
          like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software
          development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer). <br><br>

          Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages [citation needed] and allows the code editor and
          debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service
          exists. Built-in languages include C,[6] C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#,[7] JavaScript, TypeScript,
          XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Support for other languages such as Python,[8] Ruby, Node.js, and M among others is
          available via plug-ins. Java (and J#) were supported in the past. <br><br>

          The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge. The slogan for
          Visual Studio Community edition is "Free, fully-featured IDE for students, open-source and individual
          developers". As of February 19, 2024, Visual Studio 2022 is a current production-ready version. Visual Studio
          2013, 2015 and 2017 are on Extended Support, while 2019 is on Mainstream Support.[9]

          <strong> Atom</strong> is a free and open-source text and source-code editor for macOS, Linux, and Windows
          with support for
          plug-ins written in JavaScript, and embedded Git control. Developed by GitHub, Atom was released on June 25,
          2015.[8] <br><br>

          On June 8, 2022, GitHub announced Atom's end-of-life, occurring on December 15 of the same year, justifying
          its need "to prioritize technologies that enable the future of software development", specifically its GitHub
          Codespaces and Visual Studio Code, developed by Microsoft which had acquired GitHub in 2018.[9][10]
          <br><br>

          <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>Features</strong></h3>
          Atom is a "hackable" text editor, which means it is customizable using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.[11] <br><br>

          Atom is a desktop application built using web technologies.[12] It is based on the Electron framework, which
          was developed for that purpose, and hence was formerly called Atom Shell.[13] Electron is a framework that
          enables cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js.[14][15] <br><br>

          Atom was initially written in CoffeeScript and Less, but much of it was converted to JavaScript.[16] <br><br>

          Atom uses Tree-sitter to provide syntax highlighting for multiple programming languages and file formats.[17]

          CodePen is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets.
          It functions as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers can create code
          snippets, called "pens," and test them. It was founded in 2012 by full-stack developers Alex Vazquez and Tim
          Sabat and front-end designer Chris Coyier.[1][2][non-primary source needed] Its employees work remotely,
          rarely all meeting together in person. CodePen is a large community for web designers and developers to
          showcase their coding skills,[3] with an estimated 330,000[4][unreliable source?] registered users and 14.16
          million monthly visitors.[5] <br><br>

          <strong>JSFiddle</strong> is an online IDE service and online community for testing and showcasing
          user-created and collaborational HTML, CSS and JavaScript code snippets, known as 'fiddles'. It allows for
          simulated AJAX calls. In 2019, JSFiddle was ranked the second most popular online IDE by the PopularitY of
          Programming Language (PYPL) index based on the number of times it was searched, directly behind Cloud9 IDE,
          worldwide[1] and in the USA.[2] <br><br>

          <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>Concept</strong></h3>
          JSFiddle is an online IDE which is designed to allow users to edit and run HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code on a
          single page.[3] Its interface is minimalist and split into four main frames, which correspond to editable
          HTML, JavaScript and CSS fields and a result field which displays the user's project after it is run. [3]
          Since early on, JSFiddle adopted smart source-code editor with programming features. <br><br>

          As of 2020, JSFiddle uses CodeMirror to support its editable fields, providing multicursors, syntax
          highlighting, syntax verification (linter), brace matching, auto indentation, autocompletion, code/text
          folding, Search and Replace to assist web developers in their actions.[4] On the left, a sidebar allows users
          to integrate external resources such as external CSS stylesheets and external JavaScript libraries. The most
          popular JavaScript frameworks and CSS frameworks are suggested to users and available via a click. <br><br>

          JSFiddle allows users to publicly save their code an uncapped number of times for free.[3] Each version is
          saved online at the application's website with an incremental numbered suffix.[citation needed] This allows
          users to re-access their saved code.[3] Code saved on JSFiddle may also be edited into new versions, shared
          with other parties, and forked into a new line.[3] <br><br>

          JSFiddle is widely used among web developers to share simple tests and demonstrations. JSFiddle is also widely
          used on Stack Overflow, the dominant question-answer online forum for the web industry.

          <strong>StackBlitz</strong> is a collaborative online integrated development environment (IDE).[2] The
          platform allows server-side software such as Node.js to be run entirely in the web browser, enabling fully
          online full-stack development.[3] A number of web frameworks such as React, Next.js and Angular are
          supported.[4] <br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>History</strong></h3>
          StackBlitz was released to the public on August 2, 2017 by entrepreneur Eric Simons as an online integrated
          development environment for creating and sharing Angular and React projects.[1] Prior to launching StackBlitz,
          Simons had attracted media attention by secretly living at AOL headquarters for two months in 2011 while
          working on a different startup company.[5][6][7] <br><br>

          In May 2021, StackBlitz released WebContainers, a containerization solution that allowed server-side runtime
          environments such as Node.js to operate fully with web browsers. The company stated that the technology could
          boot development environments in less than a second, and was more secure than local environments due to
          running fully within the browser sandbox.[8] <br><br>

          <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>Features</strong></h3><br>
          StackBlitz offers an online integrated development environment that operates fully within a user's web browser
          as opposed to a more traditional local development environment. The software primarily emphasizes JavaScript
          development and has a large number of web framework templates readily available. Other Node.js, Python and PHP
          projects are also supported.[9]

          <strong> Replit</strong>, formerly Repl.it, is an American start-up and an online integrated development
          environment (IDE).[3] Replit allows users to create online programming projects called repls.[4] <br><br>
          <br>
          <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          Replit was co-founded by programmers Amjad Masad, Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh in 2016.[1][2] It was
          incorporated in San Mateo.[5] Once listed as a co-founder alongside Masad, Max Shawabkeh left the venture
          early on.[6][7][8] Its name comes from the acronym REPL, which stands for "read–evaluate–print loop". <br><br>

          Before creating Replit, Amjad Masad worked in engineering roles at Yahoo and Facebook, where he built
          development tools. He also helped found Codecademy. Masad had come up with the idea for Replit over a decade
          before its creation.[9] <br><br>

          In 2009, Amjad Masad sought to write implementations of other programming languages in JavaScript, but
          realized it was not practically feasible. He saw great leaps in browser and web technologies and was inspired
          by the web capabilities of Google Docs. He thought of the idea of being able to write and share code all in a
          web browser. He spent two years creating an open-source product with Haya Odeh called "JSRepl".[10] This
          product allowed him to compile languages into JavaScript. It powered Udacity and Codecademy's tutorials. After
          becoming an early employee of Codecademy, this project was put off until years later, when he and Odeh decided
          to revive the project of a programming environment in a browser.[3][9] <br><br>

          As Replit was taking shape, Masad and Odeh wanted to have "a real environment and not something emulated in
          the browser." The focus was first directed at the education market, and then later towards professional
          developers.[3] <br><br>

          Since March 2021, "replit.com" has been the default domain name for the web service replacing the older
          "repl.it". This change was attributed to Masad's preference that people pronounce the website's name as
          /ˈrɛplɪt/ instead of /ˈrɛpəl/.[10] Another reason cited by Masad was issues with the ".it" top-level domain,
          such as renewal restrictions.[11] <br><br>

          Replit originally was only a REPL. However, the Ace editor was eventually implemented, allowing for editing of
          programs as well. In 2017, Replit switched to the Monaco code editor, the same editor used in Visual Studio
          Code. Due to issues with mobile support, the code editor was switched to CodeMirror over 2021 - 2022.[12] This
          decision was met with backlash and criticism from the Replit community, which eventually calmed down after
          bugs and major issues were addressed. <br><br>

          Replit offered Teams for Education,[13] a product to assist in teaching programming in the classroom. It was
          announced that from November 15th 2023, bug fixes and features would no longer be added to teams for
          education.[14] <br><br>

          In 2024 it was announced that Replit would be moving from its SoMa headquarters in San Francisco to a new
          location in Foster City.[15][16]

          CoffeeCup HTML Editor is an HTML editor. Originally created by Nicholas Longo and Kevin Jurica, it was first
          released to the public in August 1996. Until version 12.5 released in 2012, it was capable of WYSIWYG editing.
          <br><br>

          In later versions, editing is done using HTML code, supported and assisted by a number of built-in features to
          generate and check code. While coding, a web browser preview would continuously update in a separate window or
          a split part of the main editor window (split-screen editing). However, the running internal preview stopped
          working sometime in 2023, because it relied on the long-deprecated browser Internet Explorer, which Microsoft
          disabled in a Windows update that year. In a support answer in November 2023, the Sales & Support Manager
          wrote: "At this time we do [not] have an alternative for the internal preview. We are working to rebuild the
          whole app for Chrome but we don't have an eta [estimated time of arrival] yet for that. In the mean time you
          would need to use the external preview in the browser of your choice." <br><br>

          The external preview, in a separate window, can use any and all web browsers installed on the user's computer,
          but must be refreshed manually. It does not update continuously while coding. <br><br>

          According to the authors the editor was the first to support JavaScript (version 3.5 Sep. 1996), split-screen
          editing (version 4.0, March 1997) and built-in FTP upload (version 5.2, February 1998). <br><br>

          It was voted Best Windows HTML Editor in the About.com Readers' Choice Awards two years in a row in 2011 and
          2012.[1]

          <strong>IntelliJ</strong> IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java for developing
          computer software written in Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages. It is developed by JetBrains
          (formerly known as IntelliJ) and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community edition,[3] and in a
          proprietary commercial edition. Both can be used for commercial development.[4][5]
          <br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          The first version of IntelliJ IDEA was released in January 2001 and was one of the first available Java IDEs
          with advanced code navigation and code refactoring capabilities integrated.[6][7] <br><br>

          In 2009, JetBrains released the source code for IntelliJ IDEA under the open-source Apache License 2.0.[8][9]
          JetBrains also began distributing a limited version of IntelliJ IDEA consisting of open-source features under
          the moniker Community Edition. The commercial Ultimate Edition provides additional features and remains
          available for a fee. <br><br>

          In a 2010 InfoWorld report, IntelliJ received the highest test center score out of the four top Java
          programming tools: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans and JDeveloper.[10] <br><br>

          In December 2014, Google announced version 1.0 of Android Studio, an open-source IDE for Android apps, based
          on the open source community edition.[11] Other development environments based on IntelliJ's framework include
          AppCode, CLion, DataGrip, GoLand, PhpStorm, PyCharm, Rider, RubyMine, WebStorm, and MPS.[12] <br><br>

          In September 2020, Huawei announced and released version 1.0 of DevEco Studio, an open-source IDE for
          HarmonyOS apps development, based on Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA with Huawei's SmartAssist for Windows and
          macOS.[13]

          called UltraEdit-32 was later created to run on Windows NT and Windows 95. The last 16-bit UltraEdit program
          version was 6.20b. UltraEdit-32 was later renamed to UltraEdit in version 14.00. Version 22.2 was the first
          native 64-bit version of the text editor. Starting with 2022.0 (successor of 28.20), versioning had become
          year-based.[3]

          <strong>Brackets</strong> is a source code editor with a primary focus on web development.[5] Created by Adobe
          Inc., it is free and open-source software licensed under the MIT License, and is currently maintained on
          GitHub by open-source developers. It is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Brackets is cross-platform,
          available for macOS, Windows, and most Linux distributions. The main purpose of Brackets is its live HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript editing functionality.[6] <br><br>

          On November 4, 2014, Adobe announced the first (1.0) release of Brackets. The update introduced new features
          such as custom shortcut key combinations and more accurate JavaScript hinting. Brackets has a major focus on
          development in JavaScript-enabled, CSS and HTML. With release of version 1.0, Adobe announced a feature that
          extracts design information from a PSD file for convenience of coding in CSS.[7] As of June 28, 2016, the
          feature is officially discontinued, due to low usage.[8] However, Extract is still available via Photoshop and
          Dreamweaver, both of which are part of their paid service, Adobe Creative Cloud.[9] In March 2021, Adobe
          announced it would end their support for Brackets on September 1, 2021. <br><br>

          The Brackets project was subsequently transferred to become a community-owned and driven project. The latest
          version release of Brackets is 2.2.1.[10]<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #03a9f4;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          Adobe first started development of a text editor for web development on Edge Code, which was discontinued as
          of November 2014.[11] This effort was later transformed into Adobe Brackets. With the release of Brackets 1.0,
          Adobe announced that the development of an open source application for web development was ready and was not
          an experimental project any more. Brackets contains contributions by more than 282 community contributors and
          has more than 400 requests for bug fixes and new features. Every version of Brackets had more than 100,000
          downloads, and it was the 16th most popular project on GitHub as of January 16, 2015.[12] <br><br>

          The Brackets repository on GitHub (Bracket repository) currently has 152 branches, 110 releases and 17,700
          commits as of 30 Aug 2018. The source code is freely available under the MIT license. A developer can alter
          features on Brackets and personalize it for one's own convenience by forking the software code.[13] <br><br>

          Adobe officially dropped support for Brackets on September 1, 2021 and recommended users migrate to
          Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.[14] The final official release was version 1.14.2, but a community fork
          continues to release newer versions.[15][16] In addition to the community continuation fork, Brackets
          community contributors announced Phoenix on August 30, 2021.[17] Phoenix is a fork of Brackets targeting web
          browsers, as opposed to being a native application.[18]

          <strong>Apache NetBeans</strong> is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. NetBeans allows
          applications to be developed
          from a set of modular software components called modules. NetBeans runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris.
          In addition to Java development, it has extensions for other languages like PHP, C, C++, HTML5,[3] and
          JavaScript. Applications based on NetBeans, including the NetBeans IDE, can be extended by third party
          developers.[4]<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          NetBeans began in 1996 as Xelfi (word play on Delphi),[5][6] a Java IDE student project under the guidance of
          the Faculty of Engineering and Technology at Charles University in Prague. In 1997, Roman Staněk formed a
          company around the project and produced commercial versions of the NetBeans IDE until it was bought by Sun
          Microsystems in 1999. Sun open-sourced the NetBeans IDE in June of the following year. Since then, the
          NetBeans community has continued to grow.[7] In 2010, Sun (and thus NetBeans) was acquired by Oracle
          Corporation. Under Oracle, NetBeans had to find some synergy with JDeveloper, a freeware IDE that has
          historically been a product of the company, by 2012 both IDEs were rebuilt around a shared codebase - the
          NetBeans Platform. In September 2016, Oracle submitted a proposal to donate the NetBeans project to The Apache
          Software Foundation, stating that it was "opening up the NetBeans governance model to give NetBeans
          constituents a greater voice in the project's direction and future success through the upcoming release of
          Java 9 and NetBeans 9 and beyond". The move was endorsed by Java creator James Gosling.[8] The project entered
          the Apache Incubator in October 2016.[9]

          Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi.
          Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga[6] and released a version
          to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone
          application in a graphical user interface.[7] Since its release for the Amiga, cross-platform development has
          made it available on many other systems. In 2018, it was voted the most popular editor amongst Linux Journal
          readers;[8] in 2015 the Stack Overflow developer survey found it to be the third most popular text editor,[9]
          and in 2019 the fifth most popular development environment.[10]<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          Vim's forerunner, Stevie (ST Editor for VI Enthusiasts), was created by Tim Thompson for the Atari ST in
          1987[11][12] and further developed by Tony Andrews[11][13] and G.R. (Fred) Walter.[14][15] It was one of the
          first popularized clones of Vi, and did not use Vi's source code. The source code for Vi used the Ed text
          editor developed under AT&T, and therefore Vi could only be used by those with an AT&T source
          license.[citation needed] Basing Vim on the source code for Stevie meant the program could be distributed
          without requiring the AT&T source license. <br><br>

          Basing his work on Stevie, Bram Moolenaar began working on Vim for the Amiga computer in 1988, with the first
          public release (Vim v1.14) in 1991.[16][17][better source needed] <br><br>

          At the time of its first release, the name "Vim" was an acronym for "Vi IMitation", but this changed to "'Vi
          IMproved" late in 1993.[18]

          Notepad++ is a free and open-source text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports
          tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The product's name comes
          from the C postfix increment operator; it is sometimes referred to as npp or NPP.[5] <br><br>

          Notepad++ is distributed as free software. At first, the project was hosted on SourceForge, from where it was
          downloaded over 28 million times[6][7] and twice won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer
          Tool.[8] The project was hosted on TuxFamily [fr] from 2010 to 2015; since 2015, Notepad++ has been hosted on
          GitHub.[9] Notepad++ uses the Scintilla editor component.<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #03a9f4;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          Notepad++ was developed by Don Ho in September 2003.[10] Ho first used JEXT (a Java-based text editor) at his
          company but, dissatisfied with its poor performance, he began to develop a text editor written in C++ with
          Scintilla.[10] He developed it in his spare time since the idea was rejected by his company.[10] Notepad++ was
          built as a Microsoft Windows application; the author considered, but rejected, the idea of using wxWidgets to
          port it to the Mac OS X and Unix platforms.[10] <br><br>

          Notepad++ was first released on SourceForge on 25 November 2003, as a Windows-only application. It is based on
          the Scintilla editor component, and is written in C++ with only Win32 API calls using only the STL to increase
          performance and reduce program size.[11][12] <br><br>

          In January 2010 the US government obliged US-based open source project hosts to deny access from Cuba, Iran,
          North Korea, Sudan, and Syria to comply with U.S. law.[13] As a response to what the developer felt was a
          violation of the free and open-source software (FOSS) philosophy, in June 2010 Notepad++ moved out of US
          territorial jurisdiction by releasing a version on TuxFamily, in France. Some community services of Notepad++
          (such as the forums and bug tracker) remained on SourceForge until 2015 when Notepad++ left SourceForge
          completely.[14][15][16] <br><br>

          In 2011 Lifehacker described Notepad++ as "The Best Programming Text Editor for Windows", stating that "if you
          prefer a simple, lightweight, and extensible programming plain-text editor, our first choice is the free,
          open-source Notepad++".[17] Lifehacker criticized its user interface, stating that "It is, in fact, fairly
          ugly. Luckily you can do a lot to customize its looks, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in
          functionality".[17] <br><br>

          In 2014 Lifehacker readers voted Notepad++ as the "Most Popular Text Editor", with 40% of the 16,294
          respondents specifying it as their most-loved editor.[18] The Lifehacker team summarized the program as being
          "fast, flexible, feature-packed, and completely free".[18] <br><br>

          In 2015 Stack Overflow conducted a worldwide Developer Survey, and Notepad++ was voted as the most used text
          editor worldwide with 34.7% of the 26,086 respondents claiming to use it daily.[19] Stack Overflow noted that
          "The more things change, the more likely it is those things are written in JavaScript with NotePad++ on a
          Windows machine".[19] The 2016 survey had Notepad++ at 35.6%.[20] <br><br>

          In 2015, in response to the staff hijacking of projects hosted on SourceForge, Notepad++ left SourceForge
          completely with the forums being moved to NodeBB and the bug tracker to GitHub.[16][21]

          <strong>GNU Emacs</strong> is a free software text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard
          Stallman, based on the
          Emacs editor developed for Unix operating systems. GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project
          and a flagship project of the free software movement.[4][5] Its tag line is "the extensible self-documenting
          text editor."[6]<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #03a9f4;"><strong>History</strong></h3><br>
          The original EMACS was written in 1976 by David A. Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of macros for the TECO
          editor, and in 1984, Richard Stallman began work on GNU Emacs, to produce a free software alternative to the
          proprietary Gosling Emacs. GNU Emacs was initially based on Gosling Emacs, but Stallman's replacement of its
          Mocklisp interpreter with a true Lisp interpreter required that nearly all of its code be rewritten. This
          became the first program released by the then-nascent GNU Project. GNU Emacs is written in C and provides
          Emacs Lisp, also implemented in C, as an extension language. Version 13, the first public release, was made on
          March 20, 1985. The first widely distributed version of GNU Emacs was version 15.34, released later in 1985.
          Early versions of GNU Emacs were numbered as "1.x.x," with the initial digit denoting the version of the C
          core. The "1" was dropped after version 1.12 as it was thought that the major number would never change, and
          thus the major version skipped from "1" to "13". A new third version number was added to represent changes
          made by user sites.[7] In the current numbering scheme, a number with two components signifies a release
          version, with development versions having three components.[8] <br><br>

          GNU Emacs was later ported to the Unix operating system. It offered more features than Gosling Emacs, in
          particular a full-featured Lisp as its extension language, and soon replaced Gosling Emacs as the de facto
          Unix Emacs editor. Markus Hess exploited a security flaw in GNU Emacs's email subsystem in his 1986 cracking
          spree, in which he gained superuser access to Unix computers.[9] <br><br>

          Although users commonly submitted patches and Elisp code to the net.emacs newsgroup, participation in GNU
          Emacs development was relatively restricted until 1999, and was used as an example of the "Cathedral"
          development style in The Cathedral and the Bazaar. The project has since adopted a public development mailing
          list and anonymous CVS access. Development took place in a single CVS trunk until 2008, and today uses the
          Git[10] DVCS. <br><br>

          Richard Stallman has remained the principal maintainer of GNU Emacs, but he has stepped back from the role at
          times. Stefan Monnier and Chong Yidong have overseen maintenance since 2008.[11] On September 21, 2015 Monnier
          announced that he would be stepping down as maintainer effective with the feature freeze of Emacs 25.[12]
          Longtime contributor John Wiegley was announced as the new maintainer on November 5, 2015.[13] Wiegley was
          joined by Eli Zaretskii in July, 2016,[14][16] and Lars Ingebrigtsen in September, 2020.[17]

          <strong>CodeShare</strong> The Realtime Code Editor web applications are a useful tool for enabling real-time
          collaboration among developers,
          especially when collaborating with remote teams or collaborating with clients, mentors, or tutors. They cut
          the
          need to share code through time-consuming and error-prone methods like email or file-sharing platforms. The
          specific Realtime Code Editor web application described in this research paper is developed using React.js for
          the
          front-end and Node.js for the back end, with Socket.io helping real-time communication.<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #03a9f4;"><strong>Problem Statement -</strong></h3><br>
          <li>CodeShare Realtime Code Editor web applications face challenges in ensuring the security and privacy of
            the code being
            developed and shared among collaborators.</li>
          <li> There is a need to ensure that Realtime Code Editor web applications are scalable and can manage a large
            number of users simultaneously.</li>
          <li>The user-friendliness and intuitiveness of Realtime Code Editor web applications need to be improved to
            supply a seamless and efficient collaboration experience for developers.</li>
          <li>Realtime Code Editor web applications need to be compatible with a wide range of devices and operating
            systems, allowing developers to work with their preferred tools and platforms.</li>
          <li>Efficient version control mechanisms need to be implemented in Realtime Code Editor web applications,
            allowing developers to track changes made to the codebase and collaborate effectively without overriding
            each
            other's work.</li>

          <strong>BareBones Edit</strong> is a proprietary text editor made by Bare Bones Software, originally developed
          for Macintosh System Software 6, and currently supporting macOS.<br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #009688;"><strong>History -</strong></h3><br>
          The first version of BBEdit was created as a "bare bones" text editor to serve as a "proof of concept"; the
          intention was to demonstrate the programming capabilities of an experimental version of Pascal for the
          Macintosh. The original prototypes of BBEdit used the TextEdit control available in versions of the classic
          Mac OS of the time. The TextEdit control could not load files larger than 32 KB. The Macintosh Pascal project
          was ultimately terminated, but the demonstration program was reworked to use the THINK Technologies "PE" text
          editing engine used for THINK C, which was much faster and could read larger files. BBEdit was the first
          freestanding text editor to use the "PE" editing engine, and is the only one still being developed. <br><br>

          BBEdit was available at no charge upon its initial release in 1992 but was commercialized in May 1993 with the
          release of version 2.5.[3] At the same time, Bare Bones Software also made a less-featured version of BBEdit
          2.5 called BBEdit Lite available at no cost. BBEdit Lite lacked plugin support, scriptability, syntax coloring
          and other features then deemed as mainly for advanced users. Bare Bones Software discontinued BBEdit Lite at
          version 6.1 and replaced it with TextWrangler, which was available for a fee, although significantly less than
          BBEdit. In 2005, TextWrangler 2.0 was released as freeware and subsequent versions continued to be distributed
          as such[4] up until 2017, when it was sunsetted and incorporated into BBEdit.[5] <br><br>

          Throughout its history, BBEdit has supported many Apple technologies that failed to gain traction, including
          OpenDoc and PowerTalk. The failure of PowerTalk, and the desire of developers to have email integrated to
          their text editor, led to the development of Mailsmith, an email client that uses BBEdit's editor component.
          Formerly developed by Bare Bones as a commercial application, in 2009 Mailsmith was transferred to Stickshift
          Software LLC and would continue to be developed as a labor of love and released as freeware.[6] Development of
          Mailsmith ceased in 2018.[7] <br><br>

          In 1994, taking advantage of BBEdit's then-novel plugin support, third party developers started writing
          plug-ins to easily create and format HTML code. In fact, the developers at Bare Bones Software first learned
          of the existence of HTML through users inquiring about these plug-ins. Barebones later bought the rights to
          the plugin code from their author and included them as part of the standard BBEdit package. The tools were
          included as an optional palette in version 4, and were progressively more integrated, gaining their own menu
          in version 5.0.[8] In version 4.5, Bare Bones introduced BBEdit Table Builder as an additional tool for web
          designers and developers to visually design HTML tables, then the main technique for layout control on web
          pages.[9][10] Table Builder was removed in version 6.0, since enhancing it would involve replicating the
          features of existing visual HTML editors, and BBEdit was at this time bundled with Dreamweaver.[11] BBEdit's
          plugin support was removed in version 9.6, in favor of the expanded selection of scripting languages available
          on Mac OS X. <br><br>

          BBEdit was one of the first applications to be made available for Mac OS X, as a Carbon app. On macOS, BBEdit
          takes advantage of the operating system's Unix underpinnings by integrating scripts written in Python, Perl,
          or other common Unix scripting languages, as well as adding features such as shell worksheets that provide a
          screen editor interface to command line functionality similar to MPW Worksheets and Emacs shell buffers.
          <br><br>

          BBEdit's creator code R*ch refers to Rich Siegel, one of Bare Bones Software's founders and the original
          author of BBEdit.

          <strong>TextMate</strong> is a free and open-source general-purpose GUI text editor for macOS created by Allan
          Odgaard. TextMate features declarative customizations, tabs for open documents, recordable macros, folding
          sections, snippets, shell integration, and an extensible bundle system. <br><br>
          <h3 style="color: #FF3E7F;"><strong>History -</strong></h3><br>
          TextMate 1.0 was released on 5 October 2004, after 5 months of development, followed by version 1.0.1 on 21
          October 2004.[2][3][4] The release focused on implementing a small feature set well, and did not have a
          preference window or a toolbar, didn't integrate FTP, and had no options for printing.[5][6] At first only a
          small number of programming languages were supported, as only a few “language bundles” had been created. Even
          so, some developers found this early and incomplete version of TextMate a welcome change to a market that was
          considered stagnated by the decade-long dominance of BBEdit.[7] <br><br>

          TextMate 1.0.2 came out on 10 December 2004. In the series of TextMate 1.1 betas, TextMate gained features: a
          preferences window with a GUI for creating and editing themes; a status bar with a symbol list; menus for
          choosing language and tab settings, and a “bundle editor” for editing language-specific customizations. On 6
          January 2006, Odgaard released TextMate 1.5, the first “stable release” since 1.0.2.[8] Reviews were positive,
          in contrast to earlier versions that had been criticised.[9] <br><br>

          TextMate continued to develop through mid-2006. On 8 August 2006, TextMate was awarded the Apple Design Award
          for Best Developer Tool, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California.[10] In
          February 2006, the TextMate blog expressed intentions for future directions, including improved project
          management, with a plug-in system to support remote file systems such as FTP, and revision control systems
          such as Subversion.[11] Throughout 2007, the core application changed only minimally, though its “language
          bundles” continued to advance. <br><br>

          In June 2009, TextMate 2 was announced as being about 90 percent complete, but with an undisclosed
          final-feature list.[12] A public alpha was made available for download on the TextMate blog in December 2011,
          followed by a release candidate at the end of 2016. In September 2019, a final version was released.[13]
          <br><br>

          In August 2012, TextMate 2's source code was published on GitHub under the terms of GPL-3.0-or-later,[14] an
          attempt by the developer to counteract restrictions Apple placed on software distributed through the Mac App
          Store.[15] Odgaard stated he prefers receiving patches as public domain as this preserves his ability to
          release a future version under a more permissive license, or to make a version available on the Mac App Store.
          Odgaard also stated he has a friend who uses some of TextMate's frameworks in a closed-source project, and
          they could not incorporate patches released under GPL.[16][17] <br><br>

          In October 2021, the latest/last commit was made to GitHub, though no announcement has been made to the effect
          that the project has been officially abandoned and its source code is still publicly available.[18]
